## Project Description
Our project will be a top down dungeon crawler game with enemies, loot, and traps. The user will be able to navigate a labyrinthine or dungeon environment, battling and avoiding the obstacles. The player will advance to higher levels with different maps as they play the game.

## Project Notes
 - Control to move player: W-Forward, A-Left, S-Backward, D-Right, B-Battle Enemy
 - You must click the map to give it focus in order to move the player. If the map doesn't have focus then you will be unable to move the player
 - You must battle the enemies to get the key to unlock the next level. The map will notify you once you have the key. It won't allow you to unlock any doors until you have the key.
 - The player will have to start the map over if its health drops to zero and will lose a life.
 - The player will have to start the entire game over if loses all of its lives.
 - You can keep up with player stats at the top of the map or in the game menu.
 - You must open the game menu and save the game in order to persist data for the user.
